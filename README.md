### Hi there 👋

I'm Bart, Software Dev currently at Lufthansa Systems Poland

👨‍💻 I'm currently working on my blog project, where I'd like to learn a few things - mostly about tooling, next.js, storybook features...
and who knows what else.

🧘 I'm now focused on UX/UI and building up my blog

🎯 My target is expert knowledge about Next.js
